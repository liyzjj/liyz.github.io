This paper presents a way to use neural network for a particular problem: speech denoising.
> Speech denoisng techniques aim to improve the intelligibility and the overall perceptual quality of speech signals with intrusive background noise.

# What are good points

* It advocates for learning and predicting on the raw audio, because working on the spectrogram loses the information, such as phase and timbre.

* There are a bunch of modifications proposed to adapt WaveNet for the speech denoising problem:

** Non-causality. We can access future information or latency can be afforded.

** Real-value prediction. No longer predicting softmax or distribution.

** L1 losses on noise and speech. $L(\hat{s) = |s - \hat{s}| + |b - \hat{b}|$. This is actually a very strong loss term.

** Larger receptive field on the head to prevent disruption.

** Predicting several samples at one time.

** Noise-only data augmentation
